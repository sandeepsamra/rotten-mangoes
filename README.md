Rotten Mangoes
=====================

Rotten Mangoes was a Lighthouse Labs assignment designed to introduce us to Ruby on Rails.

It is a web application that allows a user to add movies to a database, and to access particular movies using a search form. Building this app helped me learn how to create an admin, and make it so that an admin user can add, update and delete other users, and send them an email when their account is deleted.

I know it's kind of ugly, but because of the time crunch I decided to focus on functionality instead of presentation.
